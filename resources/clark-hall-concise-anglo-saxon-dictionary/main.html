PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> first edition of this dictionary
having been exhausted, it has been extensively revised, and certain new
features and alterations have been introduced into it.</p>

<p>1. The principle of arranging all words according to their actual
spelling has been to a considerable extent abandoned. It was admittedly
an unscientific one, and opened the door to a good many errors and
inconsistencies. The head form in this edition may be either a
normalised form or one which actually occurs.</p>

<p>2. Words beginning with <i>ge-</i> have been distributed among the
letters of the alphabet which follow that prefix, and the sign + has
been employed instead of <i>ge-</i> in order to make the break in
alphabetical continuity as little apparent to the eye as possible. The
sign ± has been used where a word occurs both with and without the
prefix.</p>

<p>3. References to Cook’s translation of Sievers’ <i>Anglo-Saxon
Grammar</i>, and to the Grammatical Introduction to Sweet’s
<i>Reader</i> have been taken out, as Wright’s or Wyatt’s <i>Old English
Grammar</i> will have taken their place with most English students.</p>

<p>4. A new feature which, it is hoped, will prove widely useful, is the
introduction of references to all, or nearly all, the headings in the
<i>New English Dictionary</i> under which quotations from Anglo-Saxon
texts are to be found. A&nbsp;vast mass of valuable information as to
the etymology, meaning and occurrence of Old English words is contained
in that Dictionary, but is to a very large extent overlooked because it
is to be found under the head of words which are now obsolete, so that
unless one happens to know what was the last form which they had in
Middle English, one does not know how to get at it. This information
will be made readily available by the references in the present work,
which will form a practically complete index to the Anglo-Saxon material
in the larger dictionary and will at the same time put the student on
the track of interesting Middle English examples of the use of Old
English words. Besides directing the reader (by means of quotation
marks) to the heading in the <i>New English Dictionary</i> where the
relevant matter may be found, an indication has been given of the
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
texts from which quotations are made therein, when these do not exceed
four or five<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a>.</p>

<p>5. There have been many valuable contributions to Anglo-Saxon
lexicography (by Napier, Swaen, Schlütter, Förster, Wülfing and others)
since the first edition of this Dictionary appeared, and these have been
made use of, but (as before) unglossaried matter has not been
systematically searched for words not hitherto recorded in Anglo-Saxon
Dictionaries<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a>.</p>

<p>6. The number of references to passages has been very largely
increased. All words occurring only in poetical texts have been marked.
If they occur more than once they bear the sign&nbsp;†, if only once, a
reference to the passage is generally given. If not they are
marked&nbsp;‡. As regards prose texts, the rule has been only to give
references to particular passages in the case of rare words,&mdash;more
especially <span title = "hapax legomena [words that only occur once]">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</span>. The references to AO, CP and Æ which were
given in the earlier edition have been retained, as a useful indication
that the word occurs in Early West Saxon or Late West Saxon prose, as
the case may be.</p>

<p>7. By various devices it has been found possible, while much
increasing the amount of matter in the book, to add very slightly to the
number of pages, and at the same time to reduce the number of columns on
a page from three to two. Most of these devices are more or less
mechanical, but one method of saving space may be mentioned. Certain
compound words, descriptive of places, which, as far as I know, occur
only in charters and which may often be more correctly regarded as
proper nouns, have not been separately inserted. Their meaning can
however always be ascertained by referring to their components, and
where the abbreviation Mdf is inserted the reader will understand that
examples of words so compounded, or of the components, or of both, will
be found in Birch’s <i>Cartularium Saxonicum</i>, or in Earle’s <i>Land
Charters</i>, and that references to those examples are given in
Middendorff’s <i>Altenglisches Flurnamenbuch</i>.</p>

<p>8. In the List of Abbreviations, etc. at the commencement of the
book, editions of texts which are furnished with a glossary have been
specially indicated.</p>

<p><a name = "listnote1" id = "listnote1"><i>Note</i> 1.</a> Where
references are in <i>italic type</i>, quotations from the texts
indicated will be found in the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, under the
head of the English word which is distinguished in the article by
quotation marks (see Preface). In references to special passages volumes
have been marked off from pages by an inverted full stop, and lines or
verses have been shown, <i>where they follow other numerals</i>, by
small superior figures. Occasionally where lines have not been given,
the mark ´ has been inserted to show that the quotation is in the lower
half of a page.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 2. In the following list the number (1) after an edition
of a text indicates that the edition is supplied with a complete
referenced glossary or word-index, (2)&nbsp;that it has a complete
glossary, but without references and (3)&nbsp;that it has a partial
glossary or word-index.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 3. Some of the abbreviations given below are used in
combination. Examples: MtLR = the Lindisfarne and Rushworth MSS of St

‘ ’ Quotation marks are used to enclose the English words which should
be looked up in the <i>NED</i> in order to find etymological information
as to, and examples of the use of, the Anglo-Saxon words to which the
articles in this Dictionary relate, see Note&nbsp;1 above. If they
enclose Latin words, they indicate the lemmata of Anglo-Saxon words in
glosses or glossaries etc., or the Latin equivalent of such words in the
Latin texts from which they are translated. The Latin is especially so
given when the Ags. word seems to be merely a blindly mechanical and
literal equivalent.</p>

<p>* is prefixed or affixed to hypothetical forms. Normalised forms of
Ags. words which actually exist are not usually so marked.</p>

<p>´ See Note 1 above.</p>

<p>± indicates that the Ags. word to which it is prefixed is found both
with and without the prefix ge-.</p>

<p>‡ = occurs in a poetical text, and once only.</p>

<p>== This sign is used to indicate that the words which it follows,

<h5><a name = "underline" id = "underline">
Underlining in the Dictionary</a></h5>

<p>All underlining was added by the transcriber. You will see the
following forms:</p>

<div class = "inset hanging">
<p><ins class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘errror’">errors noted
by transcriber</ins></p>
<p><ins class = "authcorr" title = "corrected by author from ‘errror’">errors noted by author</ins></p>
<p><span class = "addition">text added by author</span>
(outlined as a block)</p>
<p><a class = "external" href = "#anchors">links between files</a></p>
</div>

<h5><a name = "errors" id = "errors">
Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h5>

<p>For errors corrected by the author, see the <a class = "plain" href
= "#additions">Additions and Corrections</a> section; for errors in
<a class = "plain" href = "#anchors">cross-references</a>, see
below.</p>

<p>Errors in Anglo-Saxon words were treated more conservatively than
those in the modern text. The most common change was adding or removing
a
macron in cross-references:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
Printed text<br>
<b>mēs</b> (K) = mȳs, v. mus.
<p class = "hanging">
Cross-referenced entry<br>
<b>mūs</b> f. gs. mūs, mūse, nap. mȳs ‘<i>mouse</i>,’ ...</p>
</div>

<p>Since both headwords have a long vowel, the cross-reference was
changed to match.</p>

<p>Most errors are trivial, such as missing or incorrect punctuation or
misplaced italics. The word “invisible” in corrections means that there
is an appropriately sized blank space in the printed text. Punctuation
at the end of entries was silently regularized, and missing or invisible
periods (full stops) after standard abbreviations such as “m.” or “pl.”
were silently supplied. Other errors are shown in the text with <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "text reads ‘mosue-’">mouse-hover
popups</ins>.</p>

<h5><a name = "alphabet" id = "alphabet">
Alphabetization in the Dictionary</a></h5>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, words are spelled and alphabetized as
originally printed. Note in particular:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
The letter <b>æ</b> is alphabetized as <b>ae</b>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
The letter <b>ð</b> (eth) is alphabetized separately after <b>t</b>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
The letters <b>j</b> and <b>v</b> are not used.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
When two words are otherwise identical, the one containing a macron is
generally alphabetized second.</p>
</div>

<h5><a name = "anchors" id = "anchors">
Cross-References</a></h5>

<p>Cross-references are linked to the referenced word. When the word is
located in your current file (A-C, D-G, H-N, O-S, T-Y) the link is
<a class = "plain" href = "#anchors">highlighted</a>; when it is in another
file, the link is <a class = "external" href =
"#anchors">underlined</a>. <i>These settings may be overridden by your
personal browser preferences.</i> Your browser may take a short while to
find the word, especially if it is opening a file for the first time, so
you will generally see the beginning of the new file before being taken
to the right location.</p>

<p>Cross-references are shown as printed. When there is an error or
ambiguity, correc&shy;tions are shown in <a class = "error" title =
"like this">mouse-hover popups</a> with these standard wordings:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
<tt>under “mūs”</tt><br>
The referenced word is either a secondary entry or a parenthesized
alternative spelling in the form “mūs (ȳ)”</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<tt>headword spelled “mūs”</tt><br>
Minor difference, generally an added or omitted macron or a predictable
vowel variation such as ī for ȳ.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<tt>form of “mūs”</tt><br>
The referenced word is an inflected form. A few very common patterns
such as adverbs in “-līce” listed under adjectives in “-lic” are not
individually noted.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<tt>redirected to “mūs”</tt><br>
The cross-referenced form leads to further cross-references.</p>
</div>

<p>Most errors are minor lapses in editing. More complicated errors,
such as references to words that could not be found in the Dictionary,
are explained in separate paragraphs immediately following the
entry.</p>


<h5><i>Technical Note</i></h5>

<p>Anchors of Dictionary headwords are in the form <b>word_entry</b>
(lower case) with these modifications:</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; The letters <b>æ</b> and <b>ð</b> have been “unpacked” to
<tt>ae</tt> and <tt>th</tt>: <b>æfðanc</b> = <tt>word_aefthanc</tt></p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; Long vowels are written with q, since this letter does not
otherwise occur: <b>ham, hām</b> = <tt>word_ham, word_haqm</tt>. Long ǣ
is <tt>aeq</tt> (aē does not occur).</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; Medial hyphens were omitted. Entries with final hyphen, for
spelling variations, are generally not linked; when necessary, the final
hyphen was changed to a line&nbsp;_.</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; When necessary to resolve ambiguity, initial + or ± is included
in the anchor as <tt>ge_</tt>.</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; Headwords with multiple definitions are identified by Roman
numeral matching the text: <b>ham</b> ... <b>II.</b> ... <b>III.</b> =
<tt>word_ham_ii, word_ham_iii</tt>.</p>

<h5><a name = "hyphens" id = "hyphens">Hyphens</a></h5>

<p>In references to the OED (“New English Dictionary”), printed as
<i>italicized</i> English words in ‘single quotes’, hyphen&shy;ization
does not always correspond to the OED form. These incon&shy;sistencies
were left as printed; words split at line-end were not generally checked
against their OED form.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
